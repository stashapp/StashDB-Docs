# Joining Discourse and Discord

{: .important }
**Discourse is required for all StashDB editors, Discord is optional.**

---

All members of Stash's Discourse and Discord are expected to follow the servers' rules. These rules exist to foster a respectful community and ensure the longevity of the Stash project. The Discourse rules are listed in our [Community Guidelines](https://discourse.stashapp.cc/guidelines){:target="_blank"} and the Discord rules are listed in our [**#readme** channel](https://discord.com/channels/559159668438728723/819802026988273674/1195527590304301177){:target="_blank"}.

Please note, you will need to join the Discourse forum if you would like to [contribute more than just hashes to StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/contributing-to-stashdb/). All active editors are required to be reachable through Discourse. If there is an issue with your contributions and we cannot get in touch with you to address them, you will risk [losing your edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/).

## Discourse

Our Discourse forum is the official home for support, feature requests, and discussions about Stash and Stash-related projects. It is completely managed and self-hosted by the stashapp team. It is also the primary method for StashDB editors, mods, and admins to communicate with each other. As a result, all [StashDB contributors]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/contributing-to-stashdb/) are required to create a Discourse account.

## Discord

The Stash Discord server is the longest-running space for the community to discuss Stash, Stash-Box, and StashDB. It has far more members than the Discourse as a result, but the stashapp developers and staff have shifted most of their focus towards the forums. [StashDB contributors]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/contributing-to-stashdb/) are no longer required to have a Discord account.
