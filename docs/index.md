# StashDB Contribution Guidelines
{: .no_toc }
**Welcome to the StashDB Guidelines!**

This will serve as a guide and reference document for all contributors to StashDB. It hosts both [tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/) for new contributors as well as the guidelines themselves. Being familiar with both will help in getting your edits approved. If something is missing or doesn't make sense, please ask in the [StashDB category](https://discourse.stashapp.cc/c/stashdb/24){:target="_blank"} of our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.stashapp.cc/signup){:target="_blank"}.

This website is always a work in progress, so keep an eye out for updates. It is hosted with GitHub Pages, so please direct any suggestions for improving this website to the [StashDB-Docs repo](https://github.com/stashapp/StashDB-Docs){:target="_blank"} as a PR or Issue. Feel free to contact **@AdultSun** on Discourse or Discord with any suggestions as well.

## **StashDB Overview**
StashDB is our shared public instance of the Stash-Box software. It hosts information about a wide variety of scenes, studios, and performers that can be easily pulled into your own installation of Stash. It does not host any video files or link to any unofficial downloads.

Primarily, StashDB hosts information about professional digital content of all orientations. This means all of the major digital networks are well covered. [Amateur content]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios/) hosted on a handful of platforms is also eligible for StashDB, but services like OnlyFans and Patreon are not. JAV is also allowed but is often subject to different guidelines. Most examples of [animated content]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/animated-studios/) and [full movies]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/full-movie-entries/) are not allowed at this time, but there are a few exceptions.

Some of the content not currently allowed on StashDB can be found on other publicly available Stash-Boxes. Unlike StashDB, these Stash-Boxes are not run by the Stash team but are still directly compatible with the Stash software. [A full list of Stash-Boxes can be found here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stash-boxes/).

## **New Contributors**
For anyone who wants to browse or pull data from StashDB, you will first need to create a StashDB account using an invite token. Instructions found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stash-boxes/#stashdb). New accounts will be limited to read-only access, but will still be able to [submit fingerprints]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/whats-a-phash/) back to StashDB to help others find matches for their files.

In order to fix incorrect info or add missing data, your account will need to be granted edit access. More information can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/contributing-to-stashdb/). [Voting access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/voting/) comes later. Make sure to watch for notifications within StashDB and for messages on Discourse. These will alert you to any issues in the edit queue including possible violations of the guidelines.

***At the discretion of an admin, a userâ€™s edit access may be revoked at any time.*** This happens very rarely and is only done when absolutely necessary to maintain the integrity of both the database and the community. The most common reason for losing these privileges is a lack of communication. More information on our enforcement process can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/).

## **Getting Started Pages**
The following **Getting Started** sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require formal approval. The first topic named [StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/) covers broader topics that aren't exclusive to a single category. The rest are organized by each main heading across the top of StashDB. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage under [FAQ / Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/).

- [StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/)
- [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/performers/)
- [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/scenes/)
- [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/studios/)
- [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/)
- [Edits]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/)
- [Drafts]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/drafts/)
- [User]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/user/)
- [Search]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/search/)

## **Guideline Overview**
Guideline sections are organized by each main object type: [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/), [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/), [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/), and [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/). These parent pages are then split into the actions you can take with each object: **Create**, **Edit**, **Merge**, and **Delete**. These **Edit** pages are broken down further into each available field for that object, reflecting the order in which they appear on StashDB.

Parent pages serve as overviews of the entire category. Sometimes they will include one sentence summaries of each guideline section followed by links to more detailed explanations. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage.

- [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/)
- [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/)
- [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/)
- [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/)
