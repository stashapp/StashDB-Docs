# **Getting Started: Performers**
{: .no_toc }
The following sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database for performers. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require [formal approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#guideline-proposals).

### Handling Ambiguous Performers
- **Currently, only way is to reassign scenes to disambiguated performers individually.**

Many performer entries are considered "ambiguous", with multiple performers sharing the same entry on StashDB. This happens most often with single names with no last name or initial, for example "Anna" or "Tony". Currently, the only way to handle these is to reassign the performer on every scene individually which can be tedious and time-consuming. This also often requires the creation of multiple performer entries that do not exist separately yet, which slows down the process even more. There are plans to split these problem entries into multiple performers by studio/network to speed up the process with simple merges. This method is not possible yet.

### Performer Merge Targets
- **Typically, click "Merge" on the entry with the performer name you'd like to keep.**

When merging, click the blue "Merge" button on the performer entry you would like to keep. This will be the "merge target." Best practice is to use the entry with the preferred primary name as your merge target when possible. In other words, please refrain from merging and renaming if one of the merged performer entries already has the preferred name. This may require merging an entry with more information into an entry with less, so be sure to include any potentially lost information in your merge submission.

### Set Performance Aliases on Merge
- **Usually leave box checked unless the merged name is identical to the merge target's name.**

When merging performers, there is a checkbox that says, "Set performance aliases to old name." The performance alias is used to show what name the studio used for that performer on that particular scene at the time of release. When this box is checked, all scenes without a performance alias will fill this field with the pre-merge performer name. Typically, the box should only be unchecked (it's enabled by default) when a merged name is exactly the same as the merge target's name. We don't want StashDB to say "Jane Doe (credited as Jane Doe)" for example. This will sometimes require separating merges into two submissions: one with the box checked and one with it unchecked.

### Performer Image Sort Order
- **Ranked by size (biggest to smallest), with any horizontal (landscape) images at the end.**

Images are currently ranked by size. This means the vertical image (portrait orientation) with the largest resolution is shown first, with the rest in descending order. Any horizontal images (landscape orientation) come last, also descending in size. Knowing this, it should be easier to find and recognize images that do not meet our minimum requirements.

### Performer Image Selection
- **Variety is encouraged, allowing for different user preferences and easier identification from throughout a performer's career.**

A variety of performer images is welcomed and encouraged. This includes different "looks" from throughout a performer's career as well as various crops and poses. Different hair styles and colors, different body types or ages, with clothes or without clothes, close-up headshots or full body portraits, facing towards the camera or facing away, etc. Images that include distinctive features like tattoos may help with easier identification as well. More options on StashDB means a greater likelihood that users can find an appropriate image for importing into Stash or for identifying performers. Just be sure that any images you add don't violate any of the [separate requirements listed here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/performer-images/).

### Performer Edit Comments
- **Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

Regardless of what kind of edit you're submitting, always include in the comment field what you are doing and why. Bigger or more drastic changes will likely require longer comments, but simple changes likely won't need much. Also please remember to note what you are using as the source of your edit when appropriate. These notes will be helpful when considering further edits in addition to justifying your actions now to those who will be voting on it.

### Check Suspicious Names and Aliases
- **Exercise caution with odd looking aliases, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.**

Not all names and aliases listed on external sources are appropriate on StashDB. Aliases must have been used as an official adult credit somewhere to be eligible as a name or alias on StashDB. This disallows legal names in almost all instances. Please see [the relevant section of these guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/performer-names-and-aliases/#eligible-performer-aliases) for more details on alias requirements.

FreeOnes often uses false primary names for obscure performers as well as suspected legal names as aliases. Because FreeOnes disallows single name performers, some contributors bypass the limitation by fabricating longer names for single name performers. These usually consist of two single name aliases merged into one. FreeOnes will often list suspected legal names of performers. They are not always accurate and they are not always used publicly by the performer. These names are usually very different from the performer's other listed aliases and from typical adult performer names in general, especially when they include middle names. Be skeptical of any FreeOnes name that isn't listed anywhere else, especially if it's a combination of other aliases or if it doesn't seem like a typical adult stage name.
