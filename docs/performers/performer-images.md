### Performer Aspect Ratio
- **2:3 ratio is preferred for vertical (portrait) images.**

Our preferred aspect ratio for vertical images (portrait orientation) is 2:3. For example, a resolution of 800x1200 has a 2:3 ratio. Some images may need to be cropped with a user's choice of image editing software to achieve this ratio. There is no hard requirement for enforcing this ratio at this time.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Performer Image Size
- **Images greater than 1280px will be automatically downscaled, "low quality" images may be rejected or removed.**

The maximum size for images in the Stash-Box software is 1280 pixels. Anything larger than that in either dimension will be downscaled automatically to that size. Images may be removed as "low quality" if they are considered too small or blurry if better alternative images are available for the performer. However, no specific minimum resolution has been agreed upon at this time.

### Performer Placeholder Images
- **Anonymous placeholder images should be rejected or removed.**

Studios will often use anonymous placeholder images when they don't have anything else for a performer. These placeholder images should not be added to StashDB and any existing placeholders should be removed, even if they are the only images available for a performer. When imported into Stash, they can trick filters into thinking a performer has an image attached even though that image is functionally useless.

### Performer Watermarks / Logos
- **It is recommended to edit watermarks or logos out of performer images if possible, but not required.**

There is no hard rule regarding watermarks and logos in performer images, but it is still recommended to avoid them if possible. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted watermarks or logos with your choice of image editing software. Some programs will allow you to "heal" the logo to remove it without cropping. If the logo is unobtrusive, "healing" it would create an odd smear, or removing it entirely would result in an awkward crop, then it may be better to leave it as-is.

### Multi-Performer Images
- **Images with multiple performers should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain multiple people should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted subjects with your choice of image editing software.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Hardcore Performer Images
- **Images with explicit sex acts should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain explicit sex acts should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove hardcore content with your choice of image editing software.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### BDSM Performer Images
- **Images showing extreme BDSM practices should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain explicit or extreme BDSM practices should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Images could qualify for removal if they show severe contortions or possible injury to the body. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove explicit content with your choice of image editing software.
