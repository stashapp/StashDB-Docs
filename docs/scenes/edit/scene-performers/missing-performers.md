# Missing Performers

{: .important }
**Must include performers listed anywhere on linked webpages, including descriptions.**

---

All performers listed in the title, details, URL, or a linked webpage should be included when adding or editing a scene. This includes male performers in straight scenes. In the cases where performers who appear in scenes are not listed on the studio website you are encouraged (but not required) to find them by cross-referencing other metadata databases such as [IAFD](https://www.iafd.com/), [DATA18](https://www.data18.com/), [GEVI](https://gayeroticvideoindex.com/), etc. Please note in your edit comment why any performers are not included in your submission and add the relevant "Missing Performer ([Female](https://stashdb.org/tags/9ed214ad-f04f-4e7f-adc2-1d62c16fbcdb), [Male](https://stashdb.org/tags/38d88a3d-c22f-4b5b-a876-72a1f824481c), [Trans](https://stashdb.org/tags/2d80491c-1f2b-42e2-8ee3-45c13f6aa271))" tags to the scene.
